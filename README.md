# Excel-Projects
This is a master workbook, to make it function properly we need to change some codes in vba and in sheets so that we can design thew pipeline of the flow of data.
What it does is that it will take the data in templated attached here, then we need to open the Master worlbook and just click the 2 buttons on the first page , the refresh and then save.
Then we get a projection data saved in the projection folder.

NOTE: we need to place this Masterbook in the subfolder where we will keep the recieved data from the client, then we need to make a new folder in the folder named projection.
And then we have to update the workbook with the path of projection file
